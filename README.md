# URL Parser 
A function that takes in a URL as an argument and retrieves and parses the data in the document, and prints the grid of characters.

Restraints: 
- The document specifies the Unicode characters in the grid, along with the x- and y-coordinates of each character.
- The minimum possible value of these coordinates is 0. There is no maximum possible value, so the grid can be arbitrarily large.
- Any positions in the grid that do not have a specified character should be filled with a space character.

How to run:
1. python -m venv venv
2. pip install beautifulsoup4, requests
3. python filename url
